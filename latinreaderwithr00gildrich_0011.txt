THE text of this Latin Reader, with the exception of the Fifth Part,
consists of selections from the Lateinisches Lesebuch of Prof. anm,
to whose labors the other volumes of the series are largely indebted for
whatever practical usefuluess they may have been found to possess.

'Phe Fifth Part is made up of the 'Fifth Book of Caesar's Gallic War,
with a Syntactical Commentary, originally intended to serve as a drill·
book in Latin Syntax. Instead of mere references to the Grammar, the
rules themselves are given in as brief compass as practicable, and a system
of annotation has been devised‚ to secure, if possible, a thorough mastery
of the principles involved. The following method of working this por-
tion of the book is suggested. After the reading of the lesson assigned,
the pupil is to shut the book and repeat the rule in response to the cita
tion of the passage by the teacher. When thc rule has been given in a
previous lesson, and is simply referred to, the teacher may ask for the
rule before the close of the reading, and if it be thought expedient,
attention may be stimulated by requiring‚ in case of failure, the writing
out of the rule and the citations.

In the preparation of the Vocabulary‚ my labor has been lightened by
a careful list of the words occurring in the Fifth Book of Caesar, for
’ which I have to thank Mr. H. O. Brzocx, of Virginia3 and Ι am under
especial obligations to Mr. A. D. siluam, of New York, sor the verifica-
tion of the numerous references in the {bot-notes on the same part of
this little work.
