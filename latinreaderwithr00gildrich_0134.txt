rex cecidisset: Grote thinks that this welcome news was
not fabricated, but only-too hastily credited by Demosthenes.

³ C. 5. The Thebans persist and are crushed. Thebes is de-

stroyed(JUST1N, 9, 4). The house of Pindar alone is spared

Phocenses et Plataeenses ε Whoever was responsible for this
destruction, “ unparalleled in Grecian history,’' Alexander looked
back upon it with shame and remorse.

bellum Persicum : A Persian war of vengeance for the inva-

sion of Xerxes, of liberation for the Asiatic Greeks, had long
been a favorite scheme of Greek leaders—Antipatro: Anti-
